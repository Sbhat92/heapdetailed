# overview

Currently, heapq is the most popular library to implement a priority queue. It abstracts all operations of a min-heap from the user and does not require the user to understand the inner workings of a heap. 

heapdetailed provides the same functionalities as heapq but makes the user provide more details in all of - delete, insert and update.
